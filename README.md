# Modular App Repo 
This repo is made for testing some concepts and PoCs

### Submodules
I am here using submodules to be included in this repo, but submodules are ignored in the `.gitignore` file.
There is a strategy behind this to be explained later.

### When cloning
Please edit the file `.gitmodules` and change it's modules included.

### To clone submodules
To download (clone) submodules, you need to run the following command:
`python modules.py`
And just wait for modules to be cloned.
